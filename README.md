# StocksProgram
Uses Apple stocks from the past 15 years to determine buying and selling shares

The program asks the user to specify all of the parameters. The program will ask for the number of days to average over, the type of price to average over, the type of price to sell or buy against, the amount of stock to purchase, the amount of stock to sell, and the price the curent stock has to be to either sell or buy. The main() function carries out the main loop, that iterates over all of the days. The initial number of days to average over is looped over first, with a constant if statement. Then, the rest of the days are carried out. After the loop, the rest of the stock, if any, is sold.
